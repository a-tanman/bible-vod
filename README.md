# BibleVOTD

BibleVOTD is an extension that displays the Bible Gateway Verse of the Day (VOTD) on VS code startup, or when triggered by a command. This redirects to BibleGateway.com, but is in no way affiliated with BibleGateway.

## Features

The dialog bar will show the verse on **startup**, with an option to read the full chapter:

or on **command** 'Show Verse of the Day':

## Extension Settings

There are currently no settings but there is the intention to enable configuring the Bible version in the near future, and to allow setting when VOTD should be shown (e.g. startup, at regular time of day, etc).
